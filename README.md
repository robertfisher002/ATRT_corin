# The CoREST complex inhibitor, corin, leads to decreased tumor growth, increased cellular differentiation and extended lifespan in atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor xenograft models

### Abstract:
  - <ins>Background</ins> : Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) is the most common malignant brain tumor in infants, and more than 60% of children with ATRT die from their tumor. ATRT is associated with mutational inactivation/deletion of SMARCB1, a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, suggesting that epigenetic events play a critical role in tumor development and progression. Moreover, disruption of SWI/SNF allows unopposed activity of epigenetic repressors, which contribute to tumorigenicity. We therefore explored the role of the CoREST repressor complex in ATRT.

  - Methods We evaluated the effects of the bifunctional LSD1/HDAC1/2 small molecule CoREST inhibitor, corin, on ATRT tumor cell growth, apoptosis, differentiation, gene expression and chromatin accessibility.

  - Results We found that corin inhibited the growth of ATRT cells regardless of their epigenetic subgroup, and was associated with increased tumor cell apoptosis and differentiation. ATAC-seq showed increases in chromatin accessibility in corin-treated ATRT cells, with changes seen at genes associated with neuronal differentiation and synaptic function. RNA-seq confirmed increased expression of neuronal differentiation genes and decreased DNA replication/cell cycle-associated genes in ATRT cells treated with corin. Corin suppressed orthotopic ATRT tumor growth, leading to significant extension of lifespan. In addition, increased histone acetylation (H3K9ac, H3K27ac) and methylation (H3K4Me1) was seen in corin-treated ATRT orthotopic xenografts, consistent with on-target pharmacodynamics.

  - Conclusion The CoREST inhibitor, corin, suppresses tumor growth, induces differentiation, and promotes apoptosis in ATRT, leading to significantly increased survival of mice bearing ATRT orthotopic xenografts. Our results suggest a potential application of CoREST complex inhibitors in patients with ATRT.
